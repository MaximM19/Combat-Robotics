# Oblivion
([back to main page](../README.md))

## Current Version (V2) brief overview:
- Vertical drum spinner
- 4WD system using 2 reapt brushed drive motors
- Weapon Motor: ~~2207 1860KV Brushless~~ -> CHANGED to 2208 1800KV Brushless
- Uniquely keyed geometry
- Ability to swap between forks and wedge depending on matchup

My design skills have definitely improved and are evident not only in the bot itself but also in how the parts fit together and work properly from essentially the first print.

Design Journey

**Version 1:**

Where to start? I wanted to make something other than a horizontal spinner. Armed with my knowledge and experience, as well as many hours in SolidWorks, I jumped right in. It wasn't perfect by any means. The electronics were crammed, to say the least, and maintenance was difficult. The bunny ears for self-righting constantly broke, and the high center of mass (COM) caused heavy gyroscopic effects when turning due to the weapon. Despite all of this, it won an unofficial competition but clearly showed signs of the design reaching its limits. Following a competition at North Texas Bot Battles (NTBB) in early 2025, the damage I had ignored from my first match resulted in catastrophic failure. The design was not only poorly suited to face horizontal spinners, but it also lacked durability, structural keying, and sufficient drive speed (partly due to the heavy gyro effect when turning).

**Version 2:**

A lot changed between V1 and V2. I realized that the uprights supporting the weapon needed to be a large piece that keyed into the chassis, which meant redesigning from the ground up. Thanks to 3D printing capabilities, I decided to create a more complex and optimized drum weapon geometry, allowing for a much lower center of mass (COM) while maintaining a high moment of inertia (MOI) for the weapon, resulting in greater impact force. The general design remained similar, but now the drive features an indirect drivetrain system with a gear up to improve drive speed, as torque was no longer an issue. The drive motor shafts are also supported to prevent belt tension from flexing the motor shafts into potentially damaging positions. The weapon sits on a bearing that fits perfectly onto a small drive axle, keeping it supported from the other side. The bot has the option to use either forks or a large wedge that ties the front sides together to prevent splitting when facing a horizontal spinner. The fork configuration is still in development, with plans to use springs to ensure constant ground contact.

The current design is pictured at the top of this page and will be updated as the design is.
