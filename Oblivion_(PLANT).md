([back](README.md))
<br>Current Version (V2) brief overview:
- Vertical drum spinner
- 4WD system using 2 reapt brushed drive motors
- 2207 brushless weapon motor
- Uniquely keyed geometry
- Ability to swap between forks and wedge depending on matchup

My design skills have definitely improved and are visible not only in the bot itself, but in parts fitting together and working properly from essentially the first print.

Design Journey

**V1:**

Where to start? I wanted to make something other than a horizontal spinner. Armed with my knowledge and experience as well as many hours in Solidworks, I jumped right in. It wasn't perfect by any means. The electronics were crammed to say the least, and maintenance was well, difficult. The bunny ears for self-righting constantly broke, and the high center of mass (COM) due to the weapon caused heavy gyroscopic effects when turning. Despite all of this, it won an unofficial competition, but clearly showed signs of the design reaching its limits... and following a competition at North Texas Bot Battles (NTBB) in early 2025, the damage I ignored from my first match resulted in catastrophic failure. The design was not only poorly designed to face horizontal spinners, but also lacked durability, strutural keying, and drive speed (partly due to heavy gyro when turning at all).

**V2:**

A lot changed between V1 going to V2. I realized that I need the uprights support the weapon to be a big piece that keyed into the chassis. This meant redesigning from the ground up. Thanks to 3D printing capabilities, I decided to make a more complex and optimized drum weapon geometry, allowing me to having a much lower center of mass (COM) while keeping a high moment of intertia (MOI) for my weapon, which results in greater impact force. The general design has stayed similar, but now the drive is an indirect drive train system that features a gear up to improve the drive speed, as torque was not an issue. The drive motor shafts are also supported to prevent belt tension from flexing the motor shafts into a potentially damaging position. The weapon sits on a bearing that fits perfectly onto a small drive axle and keeps the weapon supported from the other side. The bot has the capability to use either forks of a large wedge that ties the front sides together to prevent splitting when facing a horizontal spinner. The fork configuration is still in development with plans to use springs to ensure constant ground contact.

The current design is pictured at the top of this page and will be updated as the design is.
